# Ethics and confidential data

It is important for us to make sure collaborators of the team understand clearly the implications of working on personal and confidential data. We ask that you read and answer those forms **carefully**, your answers will be used to assess your understanding of said implications and decide on granting you access to the data or not.

- [ ] Read the [ethics practices for annotators](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FPxgS4SwXHryx_Bq3YtXdmEyRBtkUrwe07ICWQEx_iU/edit){:target="_blank"} that are there to prepare you deal with manipulating sensitive and confidential scientific data. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to send a message to Alex.

- [ ] Fill in this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWYnVTCLPsXDRLTajY8Cyq9Gfv6F7-O5aH3wvsMUGiTk82Vw/viewform?usp=sf_link){:target="_blank"}.

- [ ] Copy the non disclosure agreement template: open [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14X5nryb05BpobXKoTEyJdZbrlTaTke-gl2Q1aPJI-UU/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} and go to `file -> download -> docx`
to download it as a word document. Fill in the information in your local copy and then upload it [here](https://mycore.core-cloud.net/index.php/s/hlk5R3kjRSMhs2U){:target="_blank"}.

# Ethics and authorship

- We'll often propose that you submit an abstract or paper somewhere, particularly if you aim for a career in academia.

- Typically, more junior researchers will tend to be first, and if there are several co-first, they can be in an earlier position. However, to this end, they need to contribute at the first-author level, both in terms of time and intellectual contribution.

- It takes at least 100h, and often 300h, of work to create a research project resulting in a publication. First authors will contribute between 40% and 80% of that effort. Another sizable portion of contribution will come from the last author, who will typically be Alex. The exception is when there are other senior authors involved, including postdocs in the team, who may be last (and Alex would then be second-to-last). You can expect co-authors "in the middle" (who are neither first nor last) to contribute relatively little time and effort.

- Co-authors can make many types of contribution. You can keep track of people's contributions using [CRediT](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/credit-author-statement).

- It is not enough for an individual to be co-author on a paper to have made a significant intellectual contribution to the research project. They also need to provide their agreement with the final product (paper) in a timely manner. That is, in order to be a coauthor on a paper, you have to be able to read, provide feedback, and approve of an eventual write-up. This may happen many months after you've left the team, in which case, we'll ask you to always reply to emails within a week. In the past, team members who made a contribution to a project but were not able to provide this level of continued contribution were acknowledged (i.e., they appeared in the acknowledgments of the paper and/or the portions of work that was done primarily by them appeared in the references section of the paper).

# Ethics and spending

The LAAC team is supported mostly by public funding, so we take spending seriously. This means will try to be thrifty without being cheap. 

- For people joining the team for more than 6 months, we'll discuss the possibility of buying a new computer for them. Everyone else is asked to use their personal computer, or to ask us for one among those we have in stock. 

- If you would like to present your work at conferences, that is great! We want to enable junior researchers to gain that experience and grow their network. However, we typically won't fund overseas travel or very expensive conferences. Discuss with Alex well in advance whether writing up a paper or submitting an abstract is appropriate, and how to go about it. You can see lists of [conferences for child language](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Casx-W9F04knaYF1RVO7BFZFVsOEm-aMc8Bpn-a6es/edit#gid=0) and [for speech tech/machine learning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Lg-YNKa1aW8J2GHt3S_iAllsrRLXn984imeemjSchQ/edit#gid=0). Deadlines may be past, but you can use this as a guide to find the same conferences in future years.

- If you need pens, notebooks, etc, the lab can provide it! Ask Radhia for them. The same for small tech material, like dongles & connectors -- ask Vireack for them.
